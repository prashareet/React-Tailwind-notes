HOW TO GET A JOB AS A WEB DEVELOPER?

.The most important thing is to learn with an open heart, and build things from scratch.
.In order to have a problem solving mindset you need to build things on your own.
. Coming to my perspective, where do I as a student stand realistically:
. I do have knowledge about frontend landing pages how to build them,using HTML,CSS 
. I have built the zerodha landing page and the Visual Studio landing page from scratch
    using HTML ,CSS. Do I have a proof of that work? on my device,
    I shall be able to make one more landing page - Youtube landing page I will build.
. JAVASCRIPT - I know the syntax but not a lot of inside concepts for "coding"
. BACKEND - 
    . I can do basic CRUD operations - Create, Read, Update, Delete.
    . I know about routes, and can do basic testing using Postman 
    . I can create my own HTTP server.
    . I lack filesystem logic.
    . Currently learning Basic Authentication - using Express JS and Node JS.
    . Will learn more.

. Idea: 
    . Today I was watching a film and I thought to myself I know so many things about Movies,
    can analyse scenes perfectly, can understand the deeper interpretation, Why Cant I 
    become a Film Blogger who can write Blogs about such Hidden Gems of Films, and Make my 
    blogs known to the world?
    I also thought to myself immediately, Why cant I combine Web dev with my idea and make
    a full stack app project - Hidden Gem Movie blogger or something or the other cool name
    make a blog app which has a beautiful frontend, using HTML CSS or even React if I have
    to learn it, and a basic backend using my knowledge expansion and publish it to the whole
    world, its a nice idea tho and I think I can Implement using my Skills,and in the
    process while building Learn new things. YES thats the way to learn New skills faster
    Project based learning.
