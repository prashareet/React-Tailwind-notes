How to setup a React and Tailwind project.
Theme
The theme key is where you define the customizations for your Tailwind CSS project.

extend
The extend property allows you to add or modify specific parts of the default
Tailwind configuration without completely overriding them.
For eg: {
    theme: {
    extend: {
      colors : {
        primary : "#1182c5",
        secondary : "#2aa6df",
      },
      container : {
        center : true,
        padding : {
          DEFAULT : "1rem",
          sm: "3rem",        
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
Colors
The colors key inside extend is used to define custom colors for your project.

What this does:
Adds two custom color options to your Tailwind theme: primary and secondary.
Now, you can use these colors in your CSS classes.

Custom Colors: Simplifies maintaining a consistent color palette across your project.
Custom Container: Provides a flexible and centered layout with responsive padding.
