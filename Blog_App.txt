 Idea: 
    . Today I was watching a film and I thought to myself I know so many things about Movies,
    can analyse scenes perfectly, can understand the deeper interpretation, Why Cant I 
    become a Film Blogger who can write Blogs about such Hidden Gems of Films, and Make my 
    blogs known to the world?
    I also thought to myself immediately, Why cant I combine Web dev with my idea and make
    a full stack app project - Hidden Gem Movie blogger or something or the other cool name
    make a blog app which has a beautiful frontend, using HTML CSS or even React if I have
    to learn it, and a basic backend using my knowledge expansion and publish it to the whole
    world, its a nice idea tho and I think I can Implement using my Skills,and in the
    process while building Learn new things. YES thats the way to learn New skills faster
    Project based learning. 

. It is a major portfolio boost if I can build this.
. Lets start working on this with a proper Workflow.

 Workflow: 

FRONTEND: 
. Building the frontend. We will purely Learn React, Tailwind and Use Figma to learn the 
frontend.
. Proper Movies Cover Background.
. Buttons , design akdom top quality.

- To learn Now - Building Landing pages using react and tailwind css. 
Start with easy pages. then clone youtube landing page using Figma and React tailwind.

- Backend -
. pure authentication,routes,databases, 
so i first have to build a todo fullstack app basic where user will login and post todos
and the user can CRUD, also, I have to learn about various things maybe in the process.
It will be a nearly publishable app , See the idea may be is already there but as A
student of web developer is a proper route for learning.
Lets fix a goal, Lets work and learn with this intention, I will learn a lot. 
Lets take one day at a time and finish a lot.
